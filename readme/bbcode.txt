[color=#00ff00][size=6]Challenger[/size][/color]

A mod that makes playing a challenge again. It allows you to select a challenge from a list, which restricts some parts of the game and lets you focus on another part.

The mod is automatically present in the game. You will get an mail with the [b]Magical Challenge Object[/b]™ the next time you wake up.

Using the attached object in its unmodified form will open the challenge menu. You can also open the menu using the key [K] (you can customize the key in either the mod’s config file or the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098]GenericModConfigMenu[/url]).

This will display all the restrictions you have to face - but you might get a little something extra to make the challenge possible. The [b]Magical Challenge Object[/b]™ will turn into this “something extra” once you start the challenge and can be used as any other object of the kind it turns into.

After the challenge was finished, nothing really happens. The restrictions stay in place, but at least you get a congratulatory mail. [url=https://github.com/slothsoft/stardew-challenger/issues/76]The plan[/url] is to get a reward in future versions.

[size=6]FAQ[/size]


[size=5]Can I disable / pause the challenges?[/size]

Yes, absolutely. You can just select “no challenge” in the challenge menu at any time to pause the challenge. So if not buying from Clint is no fun for you, you can just pause the challenge, buy, and then select the challenge again. Your progress might not get counted if the challenge is paused, but you’re not losing the current progress either.


[size=5]The bunny turned into a Seedmaker and now I can’t open the menu?[/size]

You don’t need the bunny, you can also press [K] to open the same menu. Then when you select another challenge, the seedmaker will change into another object (or back to the bunny again).


[size=5]Does the mod change the inventory / farm?[/size]

Your inventory and the farm will not be changed, only the [b]Magical Challenge Object[/b]™ might change. This mod is only applied to current interactions.


[size=5]Can you start challenges mid-playthrough?[/size]

You can start the challenges at any time, and you can even pause them (by selecting “no challenge” in the menu) whenever you feel like it.
