[color=#00ff00][size=6]Challenger[/size][/color]

A mod that makes playing a challenge again. It allows you to select a challenge from a list, which restricts some parts of the game and lets you focus on another part.

The mod is automatically present in the game. You will get an mail with the [b]Magical Challenge Object[/b]™ the next time you wake up.

Using the attached object in its unmodified form will open the challenge menu. You can also open the menu using the key [K] (you can customize the key in either the mod’s config file or the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098]GenericModConfigMenu[/url]).

This will display all the restrictions you have to face - but you might get a little something extra to make the challenge possible. The [b]Magical Challenge Object[/b]™ will turn into this “something extra” once you start the challenge and can be used as any other object of the kind it turns into.
